Portfolio Responsiveness & Modern UI Enhancement Prompt

Objective:
Make my existing portfolio website fully responsive and visually appealing on all devices (phones, tablets, laptops, desktops). The navigation should adapt to a hamburger menu on mobile, and the hero/about images should be hidden on small screens. The site must look clean, modern, and interactive everywhere.

1. Responsive Navbar
- On desktop and tablet: show a traditional horizontal navbar.
- On mobile (≤900px):  
  - Replace nav links with a hamburger menu icon.
  - When hamburger is clicked, show nav links vertically in a sliding drawer or dropdown.
  - Ensure hamburger is visible, accessible, and easy to tap.
- Add smooth open/close animations for the menu.
- Highlight the current/active section in the navbar.

2. Hero & About Section Images
- On desktop/tablet: show hero and about images as designed.
- On mobile (≤600px):  
  - Hide the hero section image and about section image completely to save space and improve readability.
- Ensure text is centered and well-spaced when images are hidden.

3. General Responsive Layout
- Use CSS Grid or Flexbox for all main layouts.
- All sections (hero, about, services, portfolio, contact) should stack vertically and scale gracefully on small screens.
- No horizontal scrolling or overflow on any device.
- All images and cards are responsive (max-width: 100%, height: auto).

4. Typography & Spacing
- Use modern, readable fonts (e.g., 'Space Grotesk', 'Syne', or similar).
- Adjust font sizes, paddings, and margins for readability on all screen sizes.
- Use consistent spacing between sections and elements.

5. Buttons & Interactivity
- Buttons should be large enough to tap on mobile (min 44x44px).
- Add hover and active states for all buttons and links.
- Consider ripple or subtle animation effects on buttons for a modern feel.

6. Visual Polish
- Use soft shadows, gradients, or card backgrounds for section separation.
- Add a scroll-down indicator in the hero section for desktop/tablet.
- Ensure color contrast is accessible.
- Use smooth transitions for section reveals (fade-in, slide-up, etc.).

7. Performance & Best Practices
- Optimize images for fast loading.
- Use semantic HTML5 elements.
- Test on Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and Edge, as well as Android and iOS devices.
- Make sure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible.

Deliverables:
- Updated HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
- Fully responsive, interactive, and visually appealing portfolio site that works flawlessly on all devices.

Note:
If you need to see my current code structure, ask for the latest index.html, style.css, and script.js.
